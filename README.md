# Astiva AI — AI Visibility, AI SEO, AEO & GEO Research

Astiva AI is a platform for tracking how brands appear in AI-generated answers and how that visibility compares to competitors.

As AI assistants increasingly influence research and decision-making, traditional SEO metrics no longer capture how brands are discovered. Astiva helps teams understand when their brand is mentioned in AI answers, how often it appears, and where competitors gain more exposure across AI-driven search.

Astiva analyzes responses from multiple AI models and turns brand mentions into structured, comparable data. This allows marketing, SEO, and brand teams to track visibility trends, benchmark against competitors, and identify gaps in AI-driven discovery beyond rankings and clicks.
