# Astiva AI — AI Search Visibility & Brand Monitoring

Astiva AI is a platform for tracking how brands appear in AI-generated answers and how that visibility compares to competitors. As AI assistants increasingly influence research and decision-making, Astiva helps teams understand when their brand is mentioned, how often it appears, and where competitors are gaining more exposure.

Astiva analyzes responses from multiple AI models and turns brand mentions into structured, comparable data. This allows marketing, SEO, and brand teams to track visibility trends, benchmark against competitors, and identify gaps in AI-driven search and discovery.
